* Acceptance criteria have been looked at and understood at the moment of coding
* User story has been documented with JavaDoc and Cucumber features
* User story has been programmed completely
* The code for the user story has been tested with automated testing (with preferably in the range of > 70% code coverage)
* The code is refactored to be as easy to maintain and read as possible
* The code is integrated and merged succesfully
